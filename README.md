# project.solo-api

This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis‚Äù.
This is the weekend project to learn GraphQL and JavaScript.

## Objectives

I try to implement below;

- Create CRUD API with GraphQL.
- Write Tests (Using mock better).
- Seed database.
- Describe APIs.
- Create a basic/simple frontend.

## Project Summary

Todo

## Getting Started

### Architecture

- Lang - JavaScript/TypeScript
- Server - apollo-server/express
- SchemaGenerator - nexus
- GraphQLClient - prisma
- ORM - prisma
- Database - sqlite3
- SetUp - graphql-yoga
- Other - babel/browserify

### Support Version

- node v12.18.3

Other dependency versions are written on `yarn.lock`.

### How to run the server

1. git clone this repository.

1. install dependencies with `yarn install`.

1. generate GraphQL schema with `yarn generate`.

1. initialize database with `yarn initdb`.

1. start API server with `yarn start:server`

Then you can access the API server `http://localhost:4000/`.
You can try APIs with GraphQL PlayGround.

1. start API server with `yarn start:frontend`

Then you can access the Front server `http://localhost:4010/`.

1. create seed data with `yarn seed`.

### How to change the server

### Schema

GraphQL schema is generated from `src/schema.ts` (using nexus).

If you want to define/modify schema, change this file and type these commands;

`yarn generate`

`yarn build`

### API

Nothing to do.

### Front

If you modify src/front/public/js/draw.json, type the command below;

`yarn frontbuild`

## Specification

See [schema.graphql](https://github.com/bakisunsan/cc13-project.solo-api/blob/master/schema.graphql).

And you can also try with GraphQL Playground `http://localhost:4000/`.

## Todo

[ ] Fix front javascript problem.

Error occurs in `const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')` block when running on Chrome.
It may be caused by prisma dependency version.

```
 $ browserify src/front/public/js/draw.js -o src/front/public/js/bundle.js
 Error: Cannot find module 'async_hooks' from '/Users/xxx/ghq/github.com/xxx/cc13-project.solo-api/node_modules/@prisma/client/runtime'
```

[ ] more Schema
[ ] more Query/Mutation
[ ] more Seed data
[ ] more Test
